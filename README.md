## Headers

Headers were influanced by the Material Design Guidlines. Meaning that the font being used to display the hearders including the styles were originally designed by Material Design.

The font being used is Roboto as it provides a clean and tested font that is very clear and easy to read.

## Text
---

As you can see by reading this paragraph, text also is using Roboto as the font, Infact everything that is serif uses Roboto type face.

I wanted to make text the easiest thing to read as it will be the one thing that will be looked at most while using the site.
